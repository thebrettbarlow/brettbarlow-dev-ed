          <p class="slds-var-p-vertical_small">
            I got hooked on Salesforce at Dreamforce 2013.
          </p>
          <p class="slds-var-p-vertical_small">
            I was a recruiter at this time - helping companies hire Salesforce
            Developers. After Dreamforce I started reading&nbsp;
            <lightning-formatted-url
              value="https://developerforce.s3.amazonaws.com/books/Force.com_Fundamentals.pdf"
              label="Force.com Platform Fundamentals"
              target="_blank"
            ></lightning-formatted-url
            >&nbsp;on my way to and from work (this was pre-Trailhead). I
            eventually became the first recruiter to get the Salesforce Admin
            certification.
          </p>
          <p class="slds-var-p-vertical_small">
            To pursue my passion, I joined a Salesforce Consulting firm in 2016.
            I gained a ton of experience in this role - working with different
            clients and learning from seasoned Salesforce experts. This built
            the foundation for me to land my first Salesforce Engineering role
            in 2017.
          </p>
          <p class="slds-var-p-vertical_small">
            It all came full circle when I was selected to speak at Dreamforce
            in 2018! Dreamforce motivated me to learn Salesforce in the first
            place, so it was an honor to come back as a speaker.

            As you can see from the photo of me doing the robot on stage, I try
            not to take myself too seriously. It's great when things work out
            the way we expect, but we're all bound to hit some bumps in the
            road.

            I'm a pretty casual person and I hope the content on this site
            reflects my style. Not all of the articles are perfect, but I'd
            rather share something instead of waiting until it's "perfect" and
            maybe never sharing it at all.
          </p>
          <p class="slds-var-p-vertical_small">
            I enjoy making new connections. Drop me a note if there's anything I
            can help with.
