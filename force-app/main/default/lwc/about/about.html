        Hi, I'm Brett Barlow and I'm a Salesforce Engineer.
      </p>
      <p class="slds-var-p-around_small">
        I have worked with Salesforce since 2014 and hold 10 Salesforce
        Certifications, including Platform Developer II. I have spoken at
        Dreamforce and several regional Salesforce conferences.
      </p>
      <p class="slds-var-p-around_small">
        My experience with Salesforce gives me the knowledge to architect simple
        solutions, but also the ability to push the limits of the platform when
        needed.
      </p>

        I wouldn't be where I am today without the Salesforce-related websites
        that powered much of my learning. I built this website as a way to give
        back and share my knowledge. Take a look around. I hope you'll find
        something interesting.
